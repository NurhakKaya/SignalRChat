# SignalRChat
A basic real-time chatting app using SignalR and ASP.NET Core.

ASP.NET Core SignalR is an open-source library that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to apps. Real-time web functionality enables server-side code to push content to clients instantly.

Good candidates for SignalR:

 - Apps that require high frequency updates from the server. Examples are gaming, social networks, voting, auction, maps, and GPS apps.
- Dashboards and monitoring apps. Examples include company dashboards, instant sales updates, or travel alerts.
- Collaborative apps. Whiteboard apps and team meeting software are examples of collaborative apps.
- Apps that require notifications. Social networks, email, chat, games, travel alerts, and many other apps use notifications.
